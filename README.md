# Zero Knowledge Verification of Machine Learning Robustness
## Introcution
This GitHub Repo contains the code for verify the robustness of a neural network. Each folder contains relevant code with this project. Below is the introduction for each folder in order appeared in the repo.
- Equal
  - This folder is a simple illustration of how to assign circuit, create witness, generate proof. It also shows the required addition files (go.sum and go.mod)
- ProofML
  - This is the main folder that contains the code for proving the robustness of a NN.
